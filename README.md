# Random Forest – Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Objective
To detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Random Forest on an imbalanced dataset.

## Dataset
Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Checked class imbalance
- Performed stratified train-test split
- Trained Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Trained Random Forest classifier
- Evaluated using Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Plotted feature importance
- Saved the trained model

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Saved Model
`random_forest_fraud_model.pkl`

## Outcome
Random Forest performed better than the baseline model for fraud detection.
